# File: autojob/src/keywords/keyword_utils.py

The script `keyword_utils.py` provides utility functions for merging similar strings and consolidating keywords extracted from different algorithms. The primary functionality revolves around merging similar strings and then applying this process to merge keywords extracted using different algorithms. Below is a detailed explanation of each key component:

## Components:

### 1. String Merging Functions:
- **`merge_similar_strings(list_of_strings, threshold=0.5)`:**
  - Merges similar strings from a list of strings based on a similarity threshold.
  - The function uses the Jaccard similarity coefficient to determine the similarity between two strings.
  - Similar strings are merged into a single string.
  - Duplicate words within each merged string are removed.

### 2. Keyword Merging Function:
- **`merge_keywords(textacy_results)`:**
  - Merges keywords extracted from different algorithms.
  - Accepts a dictionary `textacy_results` containing keyterms extracted using various algorithms such as SCake, TextRank, SingleRank, and PositionRank.
  - Extracts keyterm lists from the input dictionary.
  - Combines the lists into a single list of strings.
  - Applies the `merge_similar_strings` function to merge similar strings within the combined list.
  - Returns a dictionary containing the merged keyterms under the key `'merged_strings'`.

These utility functions are designed to enhance the keyword extraction pipeline within the AutoJob project by providing a mechanism to consolidate similar strings and keywords extracted from different algorithms. The merging process aids in reducing redundancy and improving the overall quality of the extracted keywords.
