# File: autojob/src/contractions_dict.py

The contractions_dict.py script defines a dictionary, all_contractions, which serves as a lookup for replacing common English contractions with their expanded forms. This is beneficial for text preprocessing tasks where it's important to standardize language. For instance, "I'm" is expanded to "I am," and "&" is replaced with "and." The script can be easily extended with additional contractions as needed for specific use cases.
