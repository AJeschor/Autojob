The acronyms.py script contains a dictionary, acronym_list, mapping abbreviations and acronyms to their full forms. This is particularly useful for tasks involving text understanding, where deciphering acronyms enhances the comprehensibility of content. For example, "AI" is expanded to "Artificial Intelligence," and "B2B" is translated to "Business-to-Business." Users can update and extend this dictionary to accommodate domain-specific acronyms.
