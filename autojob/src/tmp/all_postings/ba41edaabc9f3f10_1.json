    "description": "Help bring research to life and drive your career forward with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), Canada's largest research and technology organization.\n     \n     \n    We are looking for 2 Research Associates in early-career for the Aerosol and Gas Metrology Team to support our Metrology Research Centre. Each Research Associate (RA) would be someone who shares our core values of Integrity, Excellence, Respect and Creativity.\n     \n     \n    The selected candidates will work on research related to the optical characterization of aerosols or gases. The selected candidates will conduct research independently, while gaining hands-on experience in aerosol and gas characterization with the support of researchers in a larger team. The research team has a wide spectrum of expertise in the emerging fields of aerosol science, climate science, gas characterization, spectroscopy, and metrology. The project is expected to address emerging challenges on the climate, a priority topic at NRC. There is a focus on short lived climate forcers (including aerosols and methane, among other gases), which are significant contributors to uncertainties that limit our understanding of climate change. The incumbent will work collaboratively with NRC researchers, academics, and industry partners to develop reliable diagnostic measurements in two streams:\n     \n     \n    \n     Stream 1: A new optical instrument capable of simultaneously measuring aerosol light absorption and scattering; \n     Stream 2: An optical instrument capable of characterizing concentrations of multiple gaseous species, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane, with high precision and accuracy.\n    \n     \n     \n    The selected candidates are expected to work closely with the research team and produce refereed publications, technical reports, and/or patents (if applicable) as the project progresses. \n   \n  \n  \n   \n     Screening Criteria \n   \n   \n     Applicants must demonstrate within the content of their application that they meet the following screening criteria in order to be given further consideration as candidates: \n   \n  \n  \n   \n     Education \n   \n   \n     As part of the RA Program you must have received your PhD in Physics, Chemistry, Engineering Physics, Mechanical Engineering, or Electrical Engineering within the last five years or you expect to receive the degree within the next six months.
