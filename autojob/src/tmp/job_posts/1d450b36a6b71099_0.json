Well, for starters \u2013 with people like you!\n \n \n   Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We\u2019re the Internet\u2019s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it\u2019s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We\u2019re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We\u2019re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world \u2013 whether through 5G, or otherwise.\n \n \n   We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other\u2019s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another \u2013 from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).\n \n \n   We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we\u2019re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.\n \n \n   So, you have colorful hair? Don\u2019t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That\u2019s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! #WeAreCisco\n \n \n\n\n Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S.:\n  \n  \n \n  When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.\n  \n \n  U.S. employees have \n  access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.

We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.\n  \n \n  Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid."
