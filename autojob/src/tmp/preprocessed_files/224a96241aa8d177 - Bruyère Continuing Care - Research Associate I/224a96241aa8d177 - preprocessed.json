Our team focuses on building evidence that informs care planning and shared decision-making, for older patients and those at the end of life.\n  \n  Our research team is focused on improving communication and decision making for people with serious illness and for those nearing the end of their lives. During serious illness treatments to prolong life may not work in some cases cause harm by increasing discomfort or prolonging suffering. For people with serious illness open communication about their goals and wishes is critical. Unfortunately, when communication does not happen, treatments that are inconsistent with their goals may be administered. Serious illness care needs to be informed by what matters most to the person and by realistic prognoses for the outcomes that matter most to people. Our lab works to create values clarification tools and prognostic models to inform serious illness decision making. Join us in this important work.\n  \n  We are looking for an experienced and motivated Research Associate to join our research team. This role participates in the conceptualization and development of the ongoing and future programs of research and team growth by contributing to all aspects of the research design, analysis and dissemination.
