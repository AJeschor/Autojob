We are looking for a Research Officer, Insulation and Roofing to support our Construction Research Centre. The Research Officer, Insulation and Roofing would be someone who shares our core values of Integrity, Excellence, Respect and Creativity.  NRC Construction is implementing the \u201cPlatform to Decarbonize the Construction Sector at Scale\u201d to accelerate and scale up new technologies to help transition the Canadian construction sector towards decarbonization and contribute to the emerging low-carbon economy. It will also establish new codes, standards, specifications, and guidelines to position the sector to achieve its 2050 greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon reduction targets. These investments will help spur the growth of Canada\u2019s clean technology sector and help achieve Canada\u2019s international commitments to reduce GHG emissions.  The primary responsibility of the Research Officer (RO) is to support the goals of NRC and the Research Centre through application of research of international calibre and through the development and application of advanced building envelope and insulation technologies. The RO works in a team environment with researchers and technical experts in world-class facilities. The RO will be responsible for developing, conducting, coordinating and reporting research projects related to roofing and insulation materials, specifically 1) conducting research on sustainability of rooftop technologies (green roofs, cool roofs and nature based solutions) and 2) life cycle analysis of roofs. The RO will be applying science and engineering theories and developing technical approaches to solve roofing research challenges complementing the overall direction and research priorities for the Building Envelope and Materials (BEM) resource group. Activities also include interaction and collaboration with the construction industry, Canadian Construction Material Centre (CCMC), and researchers from universities and national laboratories.
