    "description": "The Ottawa Bioinformatics Core Facility (OBCF) of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) is located at the General Campus of The Ottawa Hospital and provides Bioinformatics support to scientists from the University of Ottawa, the OHRI and external clients. We provide services to support research scientists at all phases of their research, including a wide range of specific analysis services, including bulk and single-cell RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis, bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq analysis, ChIP-seq peak and region enrichment calling, and numerous other types of analysis as needed. We develop custom analysis workflows for client projects as needed, often involving the integration and comparison of different data types or hypothesis testing based on public -omics data sets. We provide training courses based on client specific requirements and develop and deliver training courses for partners such as the Stem Cell Network, BioCanRx and the Translation and Molecular Medicine department.\n  \n  We are looking for two experienced bioinformatics analysts to grow our team, one with Cancer research specific skills. Both candidates will have high level bioinformatics skills. The cancer specific candidate will have expertise in translational and basic cancer research. Analysts will report to the manager of the Ottawa Bioinformatics Core Facility. The Cancer support bioinformatics will be located at the Cancer Centre to promote interactions with cancer researchers. Both positions will involve research support and bioinformatics training of research personnel.\n  \n  Responsibilities:\n  \n \n  Gathering requirements from clients and proposing analysis plans\n  Implementing analyses, generating reports and figures for client use and publication.\n  Maintaining and updating bioinformatics analysis pipelines.\n  Assisting in the development and delivery of online and in-person training courses\n  Providing system administration support for locally hosted computers controlling scientific instruments and running specialized analysis software.\n  Although some virtual work will be supported, a significant presence on-site at the Ottawa General Hospital is required.\n \n  \n  Basic Requirements (Education/Experience):\n  \n \n  Bachelor\u2019s degree in bioinformatics, computer science, molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematics and/or physics with a minimum 3 years of experience programming in R and/or Python (a combination of education and experience will be considered).\n  Minimum 3 years of experience in performing bioinformatics analysis.\n  Demonstrated bioinformatics analysis experience with results published in peer reviewed journals.\n  Experience working with NGS data.\n  Strong problem-solving skills.\n  Excellent written and oral communications skills.\n  Linux system administration experience.\n  Ability to work on multiple long-term projects in a team environment.\n \n  \n  Contract Details:\n  This is a 2-year full-time contract with the possibility of renewal.\n  Salary: Min:$29.091/hr - Max:$39.463/hr\n  \n  \n Comments to Applicant:\n  Please send a complete CV with description of research experience:\n  \n  \n Contact Info:\n  Name: Gareth Palidwor\n  Title: Manager, Ottawa Bioinformatics Core Facility\n  Program: Regenerative Medicine\n  Ottawa Hospital Research Institute\n  Address: 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6\n  Email: gpalidwor@ohri.ca\n  Website: https://www.ohri.ca/bioinformatics/\n  \n  \n The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute is committed to building and sustaining a welcoming and supportive culture that promotes equity, diversity and inclusion for trainees, researchers, and staff.
