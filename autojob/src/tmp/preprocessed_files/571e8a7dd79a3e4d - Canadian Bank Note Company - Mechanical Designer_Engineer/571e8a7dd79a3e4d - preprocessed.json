    "description": "Company Description\n   We are CBN, Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited. Headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario, with primary manufacturing operations based in Canada. CBN employs over 1,800 people worldwide. CBN was established in 1897 to supply security-printed products to the Canadian government, which it has done continuously ever since. The supply of Canadian currency, passports, and postage stamps are three important activities entrusted to the Company and as a result the company is recognized as part of Canada's critical infrastructure. CBN has expanded from this base to the supply of the same and similar products to other countries and today more than half of CBN's sales originate outside of Canada. CBN creates secure documents with original designs that include a comprehensive set of intricate security features, making them extremely difficult to counterfeit. Our scientists and production team have previously developed and deployed leading innovations in substrates, inks, coatings and more. With this proven history of technical leadership, CBN has the resources and insight to develop this new, more broadly applicable technology. We are developing a new manufacturing technology that is automated, of high precision, and heavily parallelized. We will use it to make counterfeit-proof banknotes, passports, and drivers licenses. This technology has broader applicability to secure documents of all types, as well as to computers, medical uses, and environmental remediation. To support this effort, we are hiring a team of subject matter expert scientists and engineers. Job Description\n   Summary We are looking for someone who can take on all aspects of novel mechanism design from the conceptual design of complex systems through to the detailed design of individual components and parts.
