    "description": "Company Description\n   We are CBN, Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited. Headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario, with primary manufacturing operations based in Canada. CBN employs over 1,800 people worldwide. CBN was established in 1897 to supply security-printed products to the Canadian government, which it has done continuously ever since. The supply of Canadian currency, passports, and postage stamps are three important activities entrusted to the Company and as a result the company is recognized as part of Canada's critical infrastructure. CBN has expanded from this base to the supply of the same and similar products to other countries and today more than half of CBN's sales originate outside of Canada. CBN creates secure documents with original designs that include a comprehensive set of intricate security features, making them extremely difficult to counterfeit. Our scientists and production team have previously developed and deployed leading innovations in substrates, inks, coatings and more. With this proven history of technical leadership, CBN has the resources and insight to develop this new, more broadly applicable technology. We are developing a new manufacturing technology that is automated, of high precision, and heavily parallelized. We will use it to make counterfeit-proof banknotes, passports, and drivers licenses. This technology has broader applicability to secure documents of all types, as well as to computers, medical uses, and environmental remediation. To support this effort, we are hiring a team of subject matter expert scientists and engineers. Job Description\n   Summary We are looking for someone who can take on all aspects of novel mechanism design from the conceptual design of complex systems through to the detailed design of individual components and parts. This person will not only have technical skills associated with mechanical design and engineering but will also have a mindset for working on challenging and complex problems that may include elements from fields for which they may not be so familiar (chemistry, molecular physics, electrostatics, molecular mechanics, molecular machines, etc.) the persistence to work on things that may not be physically built for some time; and the ability to independently explore problems and concepts.\n   Duties and Responsibilities \n  \n   The conceptual, exploratory, and detailed design of novel mechanical systems, machines, components, and parts.\n    The analysis, modelling, and testing of proposed designs.\n    Using and aiding in the development of both in-house and commercial CAD/CAE software.\n    Selection and justification of candidate designs for further development through trade studies.\n    Development of workflows for design and analysis.\n    Requirements development and tracking.\n    Project planning and management, with guidance.\n    Participating in discussions and planning as a subject matter expert.\n    Documenting and presenting your results and progress within your team and to the company at large.\n    Collaborating with team members on all aspects of planning, development and execution of work.\n   Qualifications\n   Required Skills and Experience\n  \n    Master's degree or higher in Mechanical Engineering or similar, PhD preferred.\n    Mechanical design and/or engineering experience.\n    Effective written and oral communication skills in English.\n    Ability to work independently and take general ideas and run with them. Will get the work done and identify (and communicate) what needs to be done next. \n   Willingness and ability to rapidly learn new software tools.\n    Willingness and ability to learn supplementary material outside one's field of specialization.\n    Familiarity with diverse mechanical devices and concepts.\n  \n   Preferred Skills and Experience \n  \n   CAD/CAE experience with SolidWorks or similar.\n    Knowledge of or experience with any of the following fields would be an asset: chemistry, molecular dynamics simulation or modelling, FEM, molecular physics, controls modelling.\n    Programing or scripting experience, particularly in Python.\n    Experience with design for manufacture and assembly.\n    Experience with non-conventional mechanical design concepts (i.e. compliant mechanisms).\n    Proficient with Microsoft products (there is a possibility for some limited Linux use)\n    Experience with knowledge management, technical documentation, creating parts catalogues, or similar.\n  \n   Additional Information\n   Compensation\n  \n    Competitive Salary\n    Medical and Dental Benefits\n    Paid time off, including holidays\n    Pension\n  \n   Work Environment Preference given to those who can work in Ottawa, Canada, though there may be an opportunity for remote work elsewhere within Canada.\n   Position Type/Expected Hours of Work This is a full-time, permanent position.\n   Travel Some limited travel may be required.\n   As an Equal Opportunity Employer, Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited is committed to achieving a skilled and diversified workforce that reflects the diversity of the Canadian population. We encourage applications from women, visible minorities, people with disabilities and Aboriginal people. Canadian Bank Note Company Limited is committed to developing inclusive, barrier-free selection processes and work environments. If contacted regarding this competition, please advise the interview coordinator of any accommodation measures you may require."
