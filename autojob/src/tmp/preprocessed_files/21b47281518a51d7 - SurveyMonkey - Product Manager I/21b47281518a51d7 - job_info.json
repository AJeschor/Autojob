In addition, we've reimagined the way we work to allow employees to choose what works best for them - working in-person, fully remote, or a hybrid model that combines the two through our Choice Model. \n   Our commitment to an inclusive workplace \n   SurveyMonkey is an equal opportunity employer committed to providing a workplace free from harassment and discrimination. We celebrate the unique differences of our employees because that is what drives curiosity, innovation, and the success of our business.
